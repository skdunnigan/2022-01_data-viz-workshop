```

## CHALLENGE

Using the `diamonds` data make a scatterplot of `carat` by `price` and assign color by `clarity`.
Customize the themes and colors of the plot to make it the *ugliest* plot that you can.
Save this plot in your files pane.

``` {r ugly}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = clarity))
```
