# Missed the Workshop? Attended but lost your notes? 

Don't worry, this repository contains all the notes and exercises that were used in the live, virtual workshop. The data files used in the examples and exercises are in the `data/` folder. The `R/` folder contains `.Rmd`, `.html`, and `.R` files. 

+  It is recommended that you run the `00_package_check.R` script prior to working in the `.R` and `.Rmd` files. 
+  The exercises are presented in an RMarkdown file `.Rmd` with an associated `_helper-file.html` file. This html document presents the outcome visuals for each step of the exercises to provide the user with a goal output to check their work, since no "answer" code is provided. 
+  All the content covered through live instruction is covered as notes and code chunk examples in the `01_Visualize_Basics.Rmd` and `02_Visualize_Beyond-the-Basics.Rmd`.
+  The slides used in the live session are not provided in this repository.
